The modelix samples repository contains a couple of examples that show various aspects of the modelix platform.
Not all features of modelix are shown here so this is not a complete demo of everything modelix can do.
The primary focus of the examples is to show how you can work with language and models defined in MPS in combination with modelix.
(Meta-)models are integrated outside of MPS using JVM (Java/Kotlin) and/or web frameworks/tools.
Everythin is inteded for you to come up with tyou own use-cases and architectures based on what is provided here.
