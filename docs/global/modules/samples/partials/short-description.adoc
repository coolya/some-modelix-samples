The modelix https://github.com/modelix/modelix.samples[samples repository^] contains a couple of examples that show various aspects of the modelix platform.
The primary focus of the samples is to show how you can apply modelix to bring languages and models defined in MPS into the web.
On the basis of (meta-)models defined in MPS, external access is provided using JVM (Java/Kotlin) and web frameworks/tools.
Everything shown in the samples is intended to enable you to come up with your own use-cases and architectures based on what is provided here.

NOTE: Not all features of modelix are shown here so this is not a complete demo of everything modelix can do.
