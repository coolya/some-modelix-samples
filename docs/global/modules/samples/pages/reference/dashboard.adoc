This component provides a single page application which accesses an implementation of the sample xref:samples:reference/openapi.adoc[OpenAPI] specification.

The idea here is to illustrate a read only xref:samples:explanation/usecase-1.adoc[use-case] where a system/service outside of MPS wants to consume the content of models previously defined in MPS.
This dashboard is a single-page app showing content obtained from the intermediate REST APIs.
A user cannot edit these models from the browser.

NOTE: It does not matter whether MPS is used to store the model information (e.g. by running an MPS instance in the cloud), or alternatively the modelix `model-server` is used.


== Building & Running

=== 1. Build `spa-dashboard-angular`

You can build this subproject individually from the parent folder via via Gradle:
```
./gradlew spa-dashboard-angular:build
```


=== 2. Start an OpenAPI implementation

To run this application you will need a component which provides an API implementation conforming to the OpenAPI spec.
Thus, you need to start one of the available OpenAPI implementations in this project:

* Either start the xref:samples:reference/rest-api-json-bulk.adoc[rest-api-json-bulk] implementation,
* or alternatively you can start the xref:samples:reference/rest-api-model-server[rest-api-model-server] implementation.

Check the documentation of the corresponding project parts on how to start them.

NOTE: Make sure you have the correct ports defined in the API URLs.
This app expects `8090` by default.

=== 3. Run the angular app

Next run this single page application via:

```
./gradlew spa-dashboard-angular:npmRun
```

You can then go to http://localhost:4200 to see a dashboard with the courses model content.
